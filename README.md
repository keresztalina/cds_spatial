# Final project for Spatial Analytics S23

The code for this project was written on the authorâ€™s ASUS ROG Strix GL553VE-FY101T notebook, with Intel i7 processor and 8 Gb RAM, which runs a Windows 10 operating system. The programming language R and the integrated development environment (IDE) RStudio were used. 

The data can be downloaded from the following sources:

- data of rental apartment listings: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gaborvecsei/flats-to-rent-at-budapest ("flats.csv"); and
- data of Budapest public transport: https://bkk.hu/fejlesztesek/fejlesztoknek/ ("stops.txt", "stop_times.txt", "trips.txt", "routes.txt").

After cloning the repository locally, place the data files into the established "data" folder. Then run through the R markdown files in the following order:

1. **cleaning.rmd**: Here, you do not need to change anything.
2. **distance_calc.rmd**: Here, you do not need to change anything.
3. **map_creation.rmd**: Here, please change the parameters to fit the apartments you are searching for.
